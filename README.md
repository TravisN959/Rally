## About The Project


![Rally.io screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/oqxEJTc.png)


This project was created to help people find and organize assemblies of others in their communities, based on their topics of interest. Whether it be a grass roots movement based on sticker hunts or social issues, Rally.io is meant to allow users to efficiently and easily join movements created by others, or create their own!

Our website's easy-to-use interface allows users to do this by simply creating an account and providing their contact information, address, and topics they are interested in, in order to help locate 'rallys' that are both of interest to them, and close to home (both physically and emotionally). Each 'rally' that matches these criteria is suggested to the user in their feed, with the address, description, travel time (by car), and directions provided. Users will be notified of any upcoming 'rallys' in their area through text.
